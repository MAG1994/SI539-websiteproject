				Acanthodians are completely extinct and have no surviving members existing today. According to the fossil record, these fish first appeared during the early Silurian Period and were one of the earliest groups of jawed vertebrates and may have been the most common jawed fishes. By the Devonian period they were becoming less common and were more likely to be found in freshwater rather than saltwater. So while they survived the majority of the Paleozoic era, they were more common in the Silurian and Devonian Periods. They were relatively small, most of them growing no bigger than a meter. The spines on their fins, as well as their shark-like body, features has given them the common name, "spiny sharks". But they also had characteristics of the osteichthyans (bony fish) such as the presence of small dermal bones, and scapula coracoid element. This has made their classification difficult. Some believe that acanthodians should be viewed as a branching of earlier jawed fishes, or even a transitional form between cartilaginous fish and bony fish.
