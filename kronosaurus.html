				During the early Cretaceous period, the waters were reigned by the fierce pliosaur, <i>Kronosaurus</i>, and it may just as well have been the apex predator of these seas. At around ten meters long, <i>Kronosaurus</i> was one of the larger pliosaurs to rule the oceans, slightly bigger than its Jurassic ancestor, <i>Liopleurodon</i>. But much like its predecessor, the actual size of <i>Kronosaurus</i> has also been exaggerated. One of the most prominent skeletons on display, at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, has a length of more than eleven meters. However, this is due to an excess number of vertebrae in the spinal column, resulting in an inaccurately larger size.

				Like all pliosaurs, <i>Kronosaurus</i> preyed upon other marine reptiles. This is evidenced by the presence of tooth marks in the skeletons of plesiosaurs and other similar creatures. In order to eat larger prey, <i>Kronosaurus</i> would have grabbed onto its flesh and shook and rolled its head to tear pieces of it off, much like a modern day crocodilian. But their years of existence were numbered. <i>Kronosaurus</i> and other pliosaurs faced fierce competition from the arrival of a newer group of marine predators: the mosasaurs. These vicious reptiles would eventually run the pliosaurs into the ground and out of existence.

				Although the vast majority of <i>Kronosaurus</i> fossils have been found in Australia, there have also been some findings in Colombia, suggesting that the creatures may have lived all over the world. It is very possible that there are fossils in the western United States that are just waiting to be discovered.
