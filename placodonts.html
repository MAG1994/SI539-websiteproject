				Originating from what is now Europe, placodonts were among the very first reptiles to evolve during the Triassic Period, ultimately dying out at the end of the said period. Most placodonts grew to be about 1-2 meters in length, though larger ones grew to about 3 meters. Their dense bones and armor plating meant that these animals would have most likely remained on the seafloor and it most likely would have been very fatiguing for them to reach the water surface. This reason, as well of the type of sediment their fossils have been found in, suggests that placodonts lived in shallow waters close to shore. This negative buoyancy might have been helpful to them in the long run, since it allowed them to be close their natural prey: bottom-dwelling crustaceans and mollusks. Since they didn't have flippers or a specialized tail, they were probably slow moving and may have been preyed upon by other animals such as larger marine reptiles and sharks. Many scientists believe that placodonts may have been amphibious, crawling up on land to avoid predators, as well as rest and breed.

				Placodonts were part of a group called sauropterygians, the same group that includes plesiosaurs. But what makes them particularly stand out over other sauropterygians is that most of them had protective armor, though there were a few that did not. Many placodonts can be divided into two major groups, the Placodontoids (unarmored) and Cyamodontoids (armored). Placodontoids such as <i>Paraplacodus</i> and <i>Placodus</i> resembled large, barrel-bodied lizards. Like the name applies, they did not have extensive armor covering their bodies, though they did have armored scales running along their backs. Cyamodontoids had less maxillary teeth than Placodontoids and had extensive armor plating. In many specimens, like <i>Henodus</i>, <i>Cyamodus</i>, <i>Psephoderma</i>, and <i>Placochelys</i>, the large, armored shells gave off a sea turtle-like appearance. But despite this, these placodonts are not closely related to turtles. In fact, they do not have any known descendants.
