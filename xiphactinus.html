				At about 6 meters long, <i>Xiphactinus</i> was the longest bony fish swimming in waters of the Cretaceous. Looking like a fanged tarpon (though they were not related), it was a ferocious ocean predator; there have been countless specimens found containing the remains of partially digested prey inside their bodies. One specimen was found in containing a two meter-long <i>Gillicus arcuatus</i> fish inside its body. It is believed that <i>Xiphactinus</i> bit off more than it could chew and ended up dying when the struggling fish ruptured its stomach. Despite this however, this fish was far from the most supreme predator that inhabited these waters. Many shark fossils, like <i>Cretoxyrhina</i> and <i>Squalicorax</i>, have been found containing the bones of <i>Xiphactinus</i>. Interestingly, many <i>Xiphactinus</i> fossils have been found in the American Midwest, especially in the landlocked state of Kansas. This might seem absurd at first, but when one considers the fact that the Midwest was once covered in a shallow sea during this timeframe, known as the Western Interior Sea, this actually starts to make sense. Because of this, Kansas, along with the rest of the American Midwest, has become a treasure trove for fossils of Mesozoic marine life, including not just fish and sharks, but also lots of marine reptiles. However, since almost all <i>Xiphactinus</i> fossils that have been found have been adults, there is very little known about juvenile stages.
