				The seas of the early Paleozoic Era were dominated by eurypterids, commonly referred to as sea scorpions. Reigning from the Ordovician to the end of the Permian, they could be small enough to fit into the palm of your hand to as big as an alligator, making them the largest arthropods ever to exist. Most eurypterids had five pairs of legs, though some had an extra or a pair less. The front pair was usually a large set of pincers used to capture prey. The following three were used for walking. The last pair were shaped like oars, allowing the animal to paddle through the water. At the end of their body was a long and flexible tail called a telson, which was tipped with either a spine or a whale-like fluke. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Despite their common name, eurypterids are not actually scorpions. While they are closely related, eurypterids seem to have more in common with horseshoe crabs than they do with other arachnids. This is especially evident by their telsons, which are very similar to those found on horseshoe crabs.
				</p>
				<p>
				Like all other arthropods, eurypterids had to molt their exoskeletons periodically in order to grow. Huge mounds of molted exoskeletons from eurypterids have been found on fossilized beaches, suggesting that these beaches were mating sites. Eurypterids would migrate to a safe beach and crawl on shore in large numbers to lay their eggs and molt, much like modern horseshoe crabs. Because of these findings, some scientists believe that they were among the first creatures to venture onto dry land.
				</p>
				<p>
				As of now, more than 300 species of eurypterid have been identified. Some were massive super predators with powerful claws while others were gentle giants that sifted through the mud for tiny organisms. Some had sharp spines on their forelimbs to impale early fish while others were scavengers in the primitive reefs. The following are just a few examples of these fascinating creatures.

				<img src="images/Eurypterus.jpg" height="240" alt="Eurypterus">Like the name suggests, most eurypterid fossils belong to the genus <i>Eurypterus</i>, which lived during the Silurian. Despite this, however, the fossils of <i>Eurypterus</i> are not as widespread as other genera. Based on remains, these eurypterids mostly lived in shallow seas where they hunted smaller creatures and scavenged the remains. Larger specimens may have also hunted other species of eurypterids. Like other genera, <i>Eurypterus</i> may have moved around in one of three possible ways: crawling along the ocean floor, or by swimming either by undulating its body or paddle-like rear appendages.
				</p>
				<p>
				<img src="images/Jaekelopterus.jpg" height="240" alt="Jaekelopterus">At roughly 2.5 meters in length, <i>Jaekelopterus</i> was not only the largest of the eurypterids, but it was also the largest arthropod that has ever lived. Although it was a "sea scorpion", <i>Jaekelopterus</i> fossils suggest that the animal may have preferred freshwater over saltwater. Its massive size is simply another testament to how large arthropods grew back when life on earth first began. While there is still some debate as to how these grew to be so large, there is speculation that the high oxygen levels of the Devonian period played a role.
				</p>
				<p>
				<img src="images/Pterygotus.jpg" height="240" alt="Pterygotus">Living during the Silurian and Devonian Seas, <i>Pterygotus</i> was the second-largest of the eurypterids at about 1.5 meters long. It is one of the most well-known and successful, given how <i>Pterygotus</i> fossils have been found all over the world. It had two pairs of compound eyes; one large set at the front of its head and a smaller set on the top and center, giving the creatures a remarkable field of vision compared to most other animals of its time. The broad, flattened tail on <i>Pterygotus</i> indicates that it was probably an excellent swimmer as well. When hunting, <i>Pterygotus</i> may have buried itself in the sand, lying in wait to ambush fish, trilobites and even other eurypterids.
				</p>
				<p>
				<img src="images/Megarachne.jpg" height="240" alt="Megarachne">Another species of eurypterid that is of particular interest is the <i>Megarachne</i>, meaning "giant spider", which lived during the Carboniferous Period. The animal earned its name due to the fact that, when it was first discovered, it was believed to be an ancient spider. With a leg span of more than a foot wide, <i>Megarachne</i> was suggested to be the largest spider in the world, at one point even earning itself a place in Guinness World Records. It was only until more complete specimens were found, along with further examinations, that it was re-identified as a species of eurypterid.
