				Many people were first introduced to <i>Liopleurodon</i> through the third episode of the critically acclaimed BBC miniseries <i>Walking with Dinosaurs</i>. However, the size of the animal has been greatly exaggerated, in large part due to false speculation based on partial skeletons; the real <i>Liopleurodon</i> only to about 7.5 meters as opposed to the 25-meter-long monster in the show. Nevertheless, with teeth over seven centimeters long and jaws taking up one fifth of its total body length, <i>Liopleurodon</i> was still the apex predator of the Jurassic marine environment, hunting for fish, squid, and smaller marine reptiles. The way the animal's nostrils are positioned indicate that the animal had a very strong sense of smell, and could find prey from many miles away, like a modern-day shark. Their massive flippers gave them enough power to accelerate through the water in pursuit of a meal. Like all marine reptiles, <i>Liopleurodon</i> needed to surface in order to breathe. To see the sight of one breaching would certainly have been incredible. However, the limited fossil remains means that there is much we have yet to learn about this great marine carnivore.
