				<i>Nothosaurus</i> was one of the most prominent reptiles that lived in the Triassic Seas. Its four meter-long body was equipped with webbed feet and a strong, sweeping tail to help it traverse through the water. Its jaws were lined with long, interlocking teeth that were very effective for catching hold of slippery fish and squid, as well as small marine reptiles, like placodonts. <i>Nothosaurus</i> is believed to have mainly been an ambush predator, using its sleek, reptilian figure to sneak up on prey and catch it by surprise. Fossilized trackways found in China indicate that the animal would churn up the ocean floor in order to get at any creatures that were hiding beneath the sand.

				Like all reptiles, <i>Nothosaurus</i> needed to breathe air, but this was not a major issue. The animal's nostrils were located on top of its snout, so it could breathe at the surface of the water while staying submerged, like a modern-day crocodilian. While there’s no doubt that this creature spent most of its time in the water, there’s enough evidence to indicate that it still maintained its terrestrial roots. After long hours of hunting for prey, <i>Nothosaurus</i> would crawl onto dry land to rest and sunbathe, as well as lay eggs, just as a modern-day marine iguana. While it isn’t as popular as most other marine reptiles, <i>Nothosaurus</i> is nevertheless one of the most important ones known to man, as it marked the transition from when reptiles ventured into the sea.
