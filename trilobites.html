				Trilobites were perhaps the most iconic creatures of the Paleozoic Era. With almost 20,000 different species, these marine arthropods came in a variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from a just a few centimeters to almost a meter in length. While the Cambrian and Ordovician periods had the greatest number of trilobite species, their time on Earth spanned throughout the entire Paleozoic Era, making them one of the longest surviving animal species in history. They are among the most common fossils found in Paleozoic rocks, unsurprisingly due to their mineralized exoskeletons (most other animals at the time had softer bodies, making them more difficult to preserve). In fact, since trilobites had to shed their exoskeleton in order to grow, many cast shells were frequently fossilized.

				The diversity of body forms in trilobites reflects upon the complexity of their ecosystem, in a sense, trilobites have ended up serving as a keystone fossil for us to study the beginning of ocean life on earth. Earlier trilobite species had more body segments than later species. One of the most unique characteristics of trilobites are the eyes; these arthropods were among the first animals to develop eyes. These complex eyes, made of calcite, enabled them to have great vision to see their surroundings. There is even evidence to suggest that some trilobites may have curled up into a ball to protect themselves, like modern-day pill bugs.

				Trilobites could have traveled either by crawling, swimming, or burrowing. Their preferred method of travel seems to reflect on how they ate. Crawling trilobites were bottom feeders, burrowing trilobites could feed on small worms, and swimming trilobites captured smaller free-swimming creatures.
