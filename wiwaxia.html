				<i>Wiwaxia</i>, one of the earliest mollusks, had a very small, round body that was covered in ridged scales known as sclerites. These sclerites overlapped the animal from front to back, creating firm, but flexible armor. As the animal grew, these sclerites were shed and replaced, and the number increased as the animal grew. Its most distinguishing features were the two rows of spines running down its back, which were probably used as a defense mechanism against predators. The underside of <i>Wiwaxia</i> was the only part of the animal that did not have any armored protection. Many scientists believe that <i>Wiwaxia</i> had a muscular foot used for locomotion, much like a modern snail or slug, and also had a radula in its mouth, which it used to feed on the microbial organisms that lived on the ocean floor.
