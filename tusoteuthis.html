				<i>Tusoteuthis</i> was one of the largest squids ever to exist. However, there is not much known about this cephalopod. The only fossils that have been found so far are the gladius, the internal shell used to support squids' bodies. When the gladius was first examined, many paleontologists found the size comparable to that of <i>Architeuthis dux</i>, the modern-day Giant Squid. This led scientists to believe that <i>Tusoteuthis</i> bore a similar appearance. With a total body length of about eleven meters, including the tentacles, it would have been almost as long. However, further analysis of the gladius indicates that it bears a stronger resemblance to the gladius of <i>Vampyroteuthis infernalis</i>, commonly known as the Vampire Squid. If the creature had a similar appearance, it would have been about six meters long with a stouter mantle. But since squid tissue is very soft and does not preserve easily, the physical appearance and total length of <i>Tusoteuthis</i> will probably always remain a mystery.

				Like all cephalopods, <i>Tusoteuthis</i> was a predator that hunted fish, crustaceans, other cephalopods, and possibly even small marine reptiles. However, due to the large number of other predators in the Cretaceous oceans, the hunter often became the hunted, particularly by mosasaurs, sharks and other large predatory fish. One fossil was found depicting a <i>Tusoteuthis</i> being swallowed by a large predatory aulopiform fish. It appears to be a case where the fish bit off more than it could chew and the squid got stuck in the fish's throat, suffocating it.
