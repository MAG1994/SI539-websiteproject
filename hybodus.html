				Growing to a length of about two meters, <i>Hybodus</i> was one of the most prominent sharks of the Mesozoic Era. Its most distinguishing features were the devil-like horns above its eyes and the defensive spines in front of its dorsal fins. Inside the mouth of <i>Hybodus</i> were two different types of teeth. At the front of the mouth were sharper, more pointed teeth to grab hold of slippery prey, like squid and fish, as well as to tear chunks of flesh off of larger animals, like marine reptiles. The teeth in the back, however, were flatter and rounder, ideal for grinding crustaceans. By having two types of teeth in its mouth, the animal had the ability of eating a wide variety of foods.

				But perhaps the most intriguing aspect about this shark is that its cartilaginous skeleton was more sturdily constructed than other prehistoric sharks. The skeleton was tough and ossified, similarly to bone. Not only did it give them a possible advantage for survival, but it also means that more fossils of these sharks have been found, allowing for better understanding of these animals.
