				<i>Mixosaurus</i> may be one of the smallest ichthyosaurs, but it's still a species worth discussing in regards to the evolution of ichthyosaurs. Earlier ichthyosaurs were eel-like in body form and lacked a dorsal fin. More modern ichthyosaurs have a dorsal fin and bear a dolphin-like appearance. <i>Mixosaurus</i>, meaning "mixed lizard", is regarded as a transitional species because it has some features belong to more primitive ichthyosaurs, such as its long slender tail and five-"toed" bones in its flippers, but also some features belonging to more advanced ichthyosaurs, like its present dorsal fin and longer front flippers resulting from a more active life under the water. The front flippers act like the diving planes on a submarine, steering the animal at the desired depth it wishes to travel in as it swims. In the way that modern fast-swimming fish and cetaceans have large pectoral fins in proportion to their bodies, <i>Mixosaurus</i> could have also used its new evolutionary traits to pursue its prey. Considering the abundance of <i>Mixosaurus</i> fossils from all across the globe, this body form has been highly successful.
