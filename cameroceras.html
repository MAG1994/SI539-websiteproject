				Looking like shelled squid, the orthoconic cephalopods were among the very first of their kind to exist on the planet. The name orthocone, meaning "straight and slender" refers to the creature's long, cone-shaped shell. The largest of these was the giant orthocone known as <i>Cameroceras</i>. While there is disagreement as to how large it actually grew, it is known that <i>Cameroceras</i> is one of the largest cephalopods known to man, after the Giant Squid and Colossal Squid of modern day oceans.

				The fossils of these creatures indicate that their shells were hollow and divided into multiple chambers. The animal let water in and out of these chambers to control its buoyancy.

				As a cephalopod, there are many things that can be concluded about <i>Cameroceras</i>. The animal's head, located at the shell's opening, would have been lined with muscular tentacles, which would have been used to grab hold of prey. Nestled within the tentacles would have been a parrot-like beak that would have bitten through the protective shells of prey. The <i>Cameroceras</i> would have most likely feasted upon eurypterids, early fish, and other early cephalopods. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Cameroceras</i> has been relatively hard to define as a genus because many orthocone fossils had been falsely recognized to the genus, while other genera have been wondered to actually be part of the <i>Cameroceras</i>.
