				With a maximum length of about 17.5 meters, <i>Livyatan melvillei</i> was the largest prehistoric whale that ever lived. When it was first discovered, the creature was named Leviathan, after the biblical sea monster of the same name. However, as appropriate as it sounded, the name had already been used for a type of mastodon. The solution was to name this creature <i>Livyatan</i>, the Hebrew version. Nevertheless, it is still often referred to by its original name. The second half of the name is an homage to author Herman Melville, who wrote the novel <i>Moby Dick</i>.

				Paleontologists have concluded that the creature looked very much like the modern Sperm Whale, in large part because the creature has been identified as a physeteroid, the family of which modern Sperm Whales belong to. Like all physeteroids, <i>Livyatan</i> would have had a large spermaceti organ, filled with wax and oil that probably would have been used for ballast. Some scientists have concluded that it may have also used its spermaceti organ for echolocation to find prey and communicate with others of its kind.

				<i>Livyatan</i> had the longest teeth of any animal to exist, with a length of about 36 centimeters long. Unlike the modern Sperm Whale, which just has teeth on its lower jaw, <i>Livyatan</i> had teeth on both the lower and upper jaws. Its teeth were even larger than those of its arch-rival, <i>Carcharodon megalodon</i>, though the shark's teeth were definitely sharper. It may come as no surprise that these two predators could have crossed paths on multiple occasions and fought each other over territory and the right to hunt the same prey. Much like the <i>Megalodon</i>, <i>Livyatan</i> was an apex predator that also preyed upon smaller baleen whales. As its food supply diminished due to the changing ocean temperatures and currents, this great whale would be starved into extinction, as would its nemesis.
