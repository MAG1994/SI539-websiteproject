				One cannot talk about Mesozoic marine life without talking about <i>Archelon</i>. Living at the end of the Cretaceous, <i>Archelon</i> was the largest sea turtle ever to exist, measuring more than four meters long. Much like a modern-day Leatherback Turtle, <i>Archelon</i> did not have a solid shell, which probably would probably have made it too heavy for it to stay buoyant underwater. Instead, it had a set of bony struts which created an intricate skeletal framework, which, in turn, was covered by a tough, leathery exterior. The turtle's beak-like mouth had a prominent overbite, would have enabled it to cut soft-bodied animals like jellyfish into smaller pieces that it could swallow more easily.

				Much like modern turtles, <i>Archelon</i> held a very long life span. There is one specimen in Vienna that is believed to be over a century old and probably may have longer if it hadn't died on the ocean floor. Because of the huge predators that lived in the Cretaceous oceans, like mosasaurs and sharks, <i>Archelon</i> may have grown to such a large size out of necessity. The huge shell may have simply been too big to fit in the mouths of most of these carnivores.
