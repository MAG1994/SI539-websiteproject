				<i>Cryptoclidus</i>, meaning "hidden collarbone", earned its name due to the tiny clavicle between its shoulders. Most of the remains that have been found are about 3-4 meters in length, but some paleontologists argue that these are not fully grown and the actual adult length was about 6 meters. Fossilized evidence indicates that this animal swallowed stones, called gastroliths, which helped to aid in digestion as well as maintain negative buoyancy as it traversed through the Jurassic seas. This is a trait that can be seen in other plesiosaurs, like <i>Elasmosaurus</i> of the Cretaceous. The teeth of <i>Cryptoclidus</i> show that it preyed upon small fish and soft-bodied cephalopods and the nasal cavities in the skull indicate that it also had a strong sense of smell.

				There is some speculation that <i>Cryptoclidus</i> may not have lived a completely aquatic lifestyle; it may have spent some time on dry land, only going into the water to hunt. While there's no real way of knowing how long this animal spent on dry land vs. being in the water on a daily basis, one thing is certain: while <i>Cryptoclidus</i> would have certainly been capable of moving around on dry land, it was probably would have been a lot more suited to its marine habitat.
