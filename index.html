				<h1>Welcome to my project, an archive for marine life in ancient seas.</h1>
					<p align="left">As someone who loves the ocean and natural history, it only makes sense to combine these two interests and create a website dedicated to archiving records on prehistoric marine life. You won't find any dinosaurs here, but you will find a variety of fascinating primordial sea creatures. From <i>Anomalocaris</i>, the first apex predator in history, to giant eurypterids, ancient sea scorpions the size of a human. From the first jawless fish to the fierce, armored <i>Dunkleosteus</i>. From the trilobites that thrived in the Paleozoic, to the ammonites and the great marine reptiles that ruled the Mesozoic. From the first whales to the fearsome Megalodon, this website houses archives from loads of these ancient marine denizens. Click on any of the seas above to start exploring, then click on the creatures to learn more.</p>
					<p align="left">Disclaimer: I only chose to archive the animals that I found to be of particular interest. They are only but a handful of some of the countless marine species that inhabited the oceans over the hundreds of billions of years. If you don't see a creature that is featured on this site, you can check out other sources to find it. </p>
