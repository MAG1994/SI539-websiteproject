				Despite the second mass extinction at the end of the Triassic Period, life on Earth made a much faster recovery than it did during the first. The Jurassic Period was right at the middle of the dinosaur age, and it included some of the largest animals ever to live on land. But even the biggest dinosaurs couldn't compare with what lived in the sea.

				The Jurassic oceans were home to some of the largest species of marine reptiles in existence. Plesiosaurs, like <a href="Cryptoclidus.html"><i>Cryptoclidus</i></a>, used their sleek, streamlined bodies to pursue the vast shoals of fish that inhabited these waters. The dolphin-like ichthyosaurs, such as <a href="Ophthalmosaurus.html"><i>Ophthalmosaurus</i></a>, were in their prime near the beginning of the Jurassic Period; their numbers would decline as millions of years went on. At the top of the food chain were fearsome pliosaurs, such as <a href="Liopleurodon.html"><i>Liopleurodon</i></a>, the largest and most powerful carnivore in the Jurassic. Other notable predators included <a href="Metriorhynchus.html"><i>Metriorhynchus</i></a>, an ancient marine crocodile, as well as early sharks like <a href="Hybodus.html"><i>Hybodus</i></a>. Jellyfish, ammonites and squid-like belemnites drifted along the currents, capturing food within their tentacles. The Jurassic seas were also home to the largest bony fish, <a href="Leedsichthys.html"><i>Leedsichthys</i></a>, whose massive size would have dwarfed a modern day Whale Shark. These warm, tropical waters of the Jurassic Period were also ideal for algae as well as early species of kelp and seaweed, providing a steady food supply for the small herbivorous marine life, which in turn fed the giant carnivores that once lived in these oceans.
