				<i>Elasmosaurus</i> is one of the largest and most famous of the plesiosaurs. Most of that is attributed to its long neck, which had a total of over seventy vertebrae. This allowed for greater control of its head, and also helped to give it an edge when sneaking up on prey. With its small head such a distance away from its body, fish would probably not have been able to recognize the predator until it attacked. Since <i>Elasmosaurus</i> most likely relied on stealth to capture its prey, it probably would not need to be a particularly fast swimmer. Lining the jaws of <i>Elasmosaurus</i> was a set of long, thin teeth, which interlocked together when the animal closed its mouth, creating a death trap for any fish that it captured. Other piscivorous animals, like the pliosaurs and some pterosaurs, had a very similar arrangement of teeth. However, the teeth of Elasmosaurus were only designed to grab hold of prey; they were not designed to tear off flesh. Consequently, this creature would swallow its prey whole. Fossilized remains of <i>Elasmosaurus</i> indicate the presence of stones, which were swallowed by the plesiosaur. These stomach stones, known as gastroliths, ground together as the muscles contracted, crushing and tenderizing food for easier digestion. Since <i>Elasmosaurus</i> was fully adapted for marine life, it probably would never have gone onto to dry land for any reason, not even to lay eggs. Consequently, many paleontologists believe that it gave birth to live young. Not only that, but the stones also would have added ballast, allowing the animal to stay submerged for longer time periods.

				Many of the iconic depictions of <i>Elasmosaurus</i> portray the animal lifting its neck out of the water in a similar fashion to the Loch Ness Monster. However, because of the muscles required to support the size and weight of the neck, which needed water to help complement that said weight, this seems rather unlikely.

				Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects about <i>Elasmosaurus</i> is that it was one of the chief instigators of the "Bone Wars" a long rivalry between Edward Cope, who discovered <i>Elasmosaurus</i> and his competitor, Othniel Marsh. When Cope rebuilt the skeleton, he mistakenly put the animal's head on the tail end, resulting in much ridicule from Marsh.
