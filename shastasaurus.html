				<i>Shastasaurus</i> got its name because its remains were first discovered on Mount Shasta in California. There are three species of <i>Shastasaurus</i>, the largest of which is <i>S. sikkanniensis</i>. At around 21 meters long, <i>Shastasaurus</i> was perhaps the largest marine reptile to have ever existed, even bigger than giant shark <i>Megalodon</i>. The other two species, <i>S. pacificus</i> and <i>S. liangae</i>, were considerably smaller. At such a large size, <i>Shastasaurus</i> could hold more air in its lungs, enabling it to stay submerged longer and dive greater depths than other ichthyosaurs.

				Despite its large size, however, <i>Shastasaurus</i> had a very slender build. Even the largest specimens were less than two meters tall at the ribcage. This gave <i>Shastasaurus</i> a streamlined shape, allowing it to travel through the Triassic seas like a torpedo. The jaws of <i>Shastasaurus</i> were toothless and short in comparison to the rest of its skull. Analysis of the skulls such as where the jaw muscles were located and the location of the hyoid bones suggest that <i>Shastasaurus</i> was a suction feeder. The animal would open its mouth wide so quickly, it would have created a vacuum, sucking in anything in front of the animal, including small prey.
