				<i>Guiyu oreiros</i> is the earliest known of the osteichthyans, the group which comprises all bony fish alive today and all tetrapods as well. As a basal member of the osteichthyans, <i>Guiyu</i> is the first specimen of many characteristics which would be held by most modern vertebrates such as certain skull bones. Nevertheless, the fish also has some features, like its shoulder girdle, fin spines, and the type of scales which are known in more primitive groups of fish, such as placoderms, cartilaginous fish and acanthodians. So <i>Guiyu</i> is also a transitional species with both features of the modern bony fish and features on more primitive groups.
