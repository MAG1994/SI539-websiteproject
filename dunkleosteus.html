				If one was to think of the most monstrous fish in existence, the first images that come to mind are probably a shark, such as the Great White. But if one was to travel back to the Devonian Period, they would discover that sharks were only just evolving. And in their place was another huge predator; a heavily armored fish known as <i>Dunkleosteus</i>, the apex predator of the Devonian.
				</p>
				<p>
				The <i>Dunkleosteus</i> was the largest member of the arthrodires, a group of placoderms that had a joint on each side between its head and shoulder bones. These joints allowed the fish to open its jaws even wider than if it were to just use its lower jaw. The fearsome skull was made of bony plates that covered the creature's head and shoulders. If one were to observe a <i>Dunkleosteus</i> skull at a museum, one would notice that even the eyes had bony plates in them, known as sclerotic rings. These rings were used to both support and protect the eyes like a pair of built-in goggles. The sharp "teeth" of the <i>Dunkleosteus</i> were actually blade-like extensions of the jaws which fit together like a puzzle, giving the fish the ability to bite a victim cleanly in half.

				To ensure that <i>Dunkleosteus</i> was able to swim freely in the water, <i>Dunkleosteus</i> did not have any armor plating on the tail end of its body, which would otherwise restrict its movement. With the exception of the skull, shoulders, and pelvic areas, however, <i>Dunkleosteus</i> had a skeleton made out of cartilage, much like a modern day shark. Since cartilage does not fossilize as well as bone, no one really knows what the rest of the fish looked like, or even how long it actually was. Scientists can only make an estimation by observing modern-day sharks of similar size.
