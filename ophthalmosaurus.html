				<i>Ophthalmosaurus</i>, meaning "eye lizard" perhaps one of the most common of the Jurassic ichthyosaurs, after <i>Ichthyosaurus</i>. Like the name applies, its eyes were very large in proportion to its body, taking up most of the space in the animal"s skull. Their large size would allow more light into this animal's eye, giving it the ability to hunt in the depths were the sunlight couldn't reach. The eyes were surrounded by sclerotic rings to protect them against the pressure of deep waters.

				<img src="images/OphthalmosaurusSkeleton.jpg" height="240" alt="Ophthalmosaurus Skeleton">Scientists have concluded that <i>Ophthalmosaurus</i>, and other ichthyosaurs, for that matter, gave birth to multiple live young, as evidenced by the fossils of more than fifty pregnant females. The pups were born tail-first, otherwise they would drown in the time that it took them to escape from the mother.

				Further analysis of the bone joints show signs of damage consistent with decompression sickness, or the bends. <i>Ophthalmosaurus</i> would have needed to dive to great depths in order to get this condition, possibly either to evade predators or simply out of routine. Many paleontologists have suggested it could stay dive down more than five hundred meters deep for as long as twenty minutes. Another adaptation to live in deep water are the closely-packed vertebrae, which minimizes the possibility of gases accumulating within gases.
