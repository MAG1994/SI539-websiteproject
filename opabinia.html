				One of the oddest-looking creatures that lived in the Cambrian Period was the <i>Opabinia</i>. Having five eyes and a long proboscis used for feeding, its appearance is so bizarre that it was initially met with ridicule when its identity was first confirmed in 1972. However, if one were to look at <i>Opabinia</i> in comparison to some of the other species that lived during the Cambrian Period, than it actually does not appear to be anything out of the norm.

				On average, their segmented bodies were between 4-7 cm. (1.5-3 in.) long, not including the proboscis, which was a third of its body length. The proboscis had a pincer on the end of it and the striations suggest that it was flexible. Some scientists believed that it enabled the <i>Opabinia</i> to probe around in burrows on the seafloor in search of worms and other prey. Although its body was segmented like a trilobite's, fossil evidence suggests that it was soft and lacked a hard exoskeleton. Due to its soft body, the impressions of the <i>Opabinia's</i> internal organs have occasionally been erroneously identified as external features. Considering its unusual appearance, scientists have found it difficult to put <i>Opabinia</i> into a certain group, but most of them agree that it was closely related to the early arthropods.
