				If one was to make a list of the top ten prehistoric marine predators, there's a very good chance that <i>Megalodon</i> would be very near the top of the list, if not the number one choice overall, and for good reason. After dinosaurs, <i>Megalodon</i> is one of the most popular prehistoric animals out there. It has made many appearances in pop culture, ranging from books, to movies, to even videogames. However, most of these depictions have been highly fictionalized, ranging from exaggerated size to being able to leap impossible heights, to being able to sink large warships. So what was the real <i>Megalodon</i> like?
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Carcharodon megalodon</i> was the largest shark that ever existed. Like most prehistoric sharks, the cartilaginous skeleton of <i>Megalodon</i> did not preserve well, so most the evidence from this creature's existence comes in the form of fossilized teeth, as well as the occasional jaws. The teeth and the shape of the jaws are virtually identical to the most feared predator living in our oceans today, the Great White Shark (<i>Carcharodon carcharias</i>). Because of this, most scientists concluded that <i>Megalodon</i> was its ancestor and most likely was very similar in appearance. The main difference, however, is that they were more than three times the size of a Great White. By using these fossilized teeth, scientists have been able to estimate the animal's size at roughly 20 meters, making it one of the largest marine predators ever, even bigger than most of the great marine reptiles of the Mesozoic.

				<img src="images/MegalodonTooth.jpg" height="240" alt="Megalodon Tooth">According to a study done in 2008, <i>Megalodon</i> had a bite force between 108,514-182,201 Newtons, giving it the strongest bite force of any animal in existence. Such a massive predator requires massive prey, so the shark almost certainly preyed upon the many whales that thrived in the Neogene seas. This is evidenced by many whale bones having indentations caused by the teeth of these sharks. Another interesting element that proves this is that some whales have damage to their spinal columns that caused by a massive blow from underneath. Many have speculated that <i>Megalodon</i> attacked smaller whales by charging at them from the depths below, much like modern Great Whites do with seals. For larger whales, <i>Megalodon</i> may have bitten off the fins of the victim to incapacitate it before going in for the kill. The arrival of the ice age and the decrease of its food supply would ultimately spell doom for <i>Megalodon</i>. Some people who believe that <i>Megalodon</i> may still be roaming deep beneath the waves, but there's no evidence to support these theories. It may no longer be around, but this massive shark still captures our imagination to this day.
