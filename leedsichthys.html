				If one was to be asked what the world's largest fish is, the person would probably answer Whale Shark. But if the question was what the largest fish that ever existed, that distinction would probably go to <i>Leedsichthys problematicus</i>, which lived in the oceans during the Jurassic period. The fish earned its species name due to the problems involved in recovering and recreating the first one. There have been dozens of fossil remains found all across the globe, but these fossils were incomplete, so researchers have been only able to speculate on the fish's length due to fossil fragments. While the estimates vary, many have concluded that <i>Leedsichthys</i> could have grown to a maximum of 16.5 meters. By comparison, the largest Whale Shark ever recorded was about twelve meters in length. Some estimates raise the maximum length to over twenty meters in length, even bigger than <i>Megalodon</i>.

				Like many scientific discoveries, the existence of <i>Leedsichthys</i> came to our knowledge by accident. Two students were working on a geology project at a quarry in England when they noticed pieces of bone sticking out of the rocks. It turned out to be the remains of <i>Leedsichthys</i>. Paleontologists were ecstatic over its discovery because it was hard evidence that while dinosaurs experienced a massive growth on land, sea creatures were undergoing various changes.

				Although <i>Leedsichthys</i> had a mouth large enough to swallow a man whole, lined with 40,000 teeth, this fish was no predator. Much like the Whale Shark and the Basking Shark, <i>Leedsichthys</i> swam through the sunlit waters feeding on plankton and other tiny creatures and was perhaps one of the earliest filter-feeders to be recognized.
