				When <i>Anomalocaris</i> was first discovered, only one of its feeding appendages and its mouth was found, initially leading scientists to believe that they had found a prehistoric shrimp and a jellyfish, respectively. It wasn't until almost a century later, after a complete specimen was found, that scientists discovered that these two separate organisms were actually part of a much larger creature, believed to be the world's first super-predator.

				At over a meter in length, <i>Anomalocaris</i> was one of the biggest animals during the Cambrian period. Its body had fin-like folds which undulated like a modern cuttlefish for locomotion. In front of its head were its distinguishing claw-like mouthparts, which worked like a spider's pedipalps, grabbing food and bringing it towards its mouth. Many trilobite fossils have been found with massive wounds on their exoskeletons, suggesting that they were common prey for this ancient predator.

				But there is also speculation that not all members of the <i>Anomalocaris</i> family were predators. Some of them may have been filter feeders, using the spines on their mouthparts like a comb to sift through the sediment on the ocean floor in search of food.
