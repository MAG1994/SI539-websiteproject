				Growing to a length of about two meters, the early dolphin <i>Eurhinodelphis</i> was one of the most common cetaceans in the mid-Neogene seas. Nevertheless, this animal was quite primitive compared to the dolphins living in the oceans today. First and foremost, <i>Eurhinodelphis</i> had teeth that varied in shape and size depending on where they were located in the creature's mouth as well as their purpose (such as incisors, canines, and molars on most land mammals. These teeth were a remnant from when they first originated on land during the Paleogene. By contrast, most modern dolphins, and other toothed whales for that matter, have peg-shaped teeth that are uniform throughout the mouth. Nevertheless, <i>Eurhinodelphis</i> were still small, like a modern dolphin, indicating that they shared a similar diet, like fish, squid, and crustaceans.

				Perhaps the most prominent feature of <i>Eurhinodelphis</i> was its very long snout, even longer than the River Dolphins that exist today. The big difference between the snouts of this dolphin and most modern day species is that <i>Eurhinodelphis</i> lacked any teeth in front of the snout. Some paleontologists believe that it may have used the toothless end to dig and sift through the seafloor in search of prey. This is an action that has also been observed in most modern dolphins. Still, other paleontologists believe that <i>Eurhinodelphis</i> used its snout to thrash into schools of fish to make them easier to catch, like a modern-day marlin. These creatures ultimately would set the standards for the modern dolphins that we see today.
