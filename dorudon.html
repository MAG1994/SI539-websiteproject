				When the fossils of <i>Dorudon</i> were first discovered, they were so similar to the much larger <i>Basilosaurus</i>, that many paleontologists believed that they were actually <i>Basilosaurus</i> calves. It wasn't until the discovery of actual <i>Dorudon</i> calves that scientists realized it was a completely different animal. Many of these calves have been found with bite marks in them, which pair up with the teeth of the <i>Basilosaurus</i>, indicating that there was a predator-prey relationship between the two. While it was a prey animal, <i>Dorudon</i> was also a predator, hunting for fish and other smaller creatures that lived in the Paleogene seas. Like most other primitive whales, including <i>Basilosaurus</i>, <i>Dorudon</i> did not have a melon in its head which enabled it to detect sounds. So therefore, it was not able to echolocate like more modern whales. The evolution of echolocation would prove vital as whales grew more diverse, and began feeding on a wider variety of prey.
