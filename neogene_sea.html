				Although the first pinnipeds appeared at the very end of the preceding Paleogene Period, they didn't especially flourish until the Neogene. The oceans also oversaw the evolution of whales into their more modern forms. Among these new whale species was the wide-ranging <i>Cetotherium</i>, one of the earliest baleen whales, and <a href="Eurhinodelphis.html"><i>Eurhinodelphis</i></a>, one of the first dolphins. They were, in turn, hunted by predators such as <a href="Livyatan.html"><i>Livyatan</i></a>, a huge, prehistoric carnivore that was the ancestor of the modern Sperm Whale.
				</p>
				<p>
				As fearsome a predator as <i>Livyatan</i> was, it still wasn't able to beat the many sharks that still ruled at the top of the food web, the largest of these was the <a href="Megalodon.html"><i>Megalodon</i></a>. The ancestor of the modern Great White Shark, the <i>Megalodon</i> was a ferocious hunter that could easily make a quick meal out of even the largest of whales. Even then, however, it was no match to the rapid cooling of the ocean's temperatures. As other whales learned to adapt to the arrival of the ice age, this shark and many other sea creatures simply vanished off the face of the Earth.
