				At three feet long, <i>Stethacanthus</i> was a relatively small shark that, in many ways, was very similar to other sharks that evolved during the Devonian Period-that was except for its most iconic feature. <i>Stethacanthus</i> had an anvil-shaped dorsal fin that jutted out of its back like a radar mast. The most interesting aspect about this ancient shark is that the only fossils discovered have been from males, as evidenced by the presence of claspers. Ironically, a very similar shark called <i>Symmorium</i> is represented by only female specimens. Because if this, many scientists believe that that the female <i>Stethacanthus</i> has been misidentified as a completely different shark species.

				The male's dorsal fin was topped with a thick layer of enlarged denticles as was the top of his head. There have been many theories as to why the shark had this fin. One of the most common of these theories is that he used it to clamp onto the underside of a larger animal and hitched a ride, like a modern-day remora. But perhaps the most likely theory was that it was used for mating purposes, both passively and actively. From a passive stance, the females would have chosen the males that had the best-looking fin and denticles. From a more active stance, competing males might have had pushing matches to test each other's strength, much like modern-day deer or bighorn sheep. But these are nothing more than just theories; the real answer will probably always be a mystery.
