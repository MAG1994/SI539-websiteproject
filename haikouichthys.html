				Although it was only about an inch long, <i>Haikouichthys</i> was a major player in the evolution game. It was one of, if not the, first ever species of fish to evolve, thus making it one of the first vertebrates to come into fruition. <i>Haikouichthys</i> had at least six sets of gills, a distinct head with a defined skull, and a notochord (primitive backbone), making it one of the most complex animal species of the Cambrian Period. These became the forerunners for all vertebrates, from reptiles and amphibians, to mammals.
