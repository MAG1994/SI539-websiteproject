				Despite being one of the first sharks to evolve, the four-foot-long <i>Cladoselache</i> was not like other sharks during this time frame. Its mouth was located in front of its head as opposed to being tucked behind its snout like most sharks. Inside its mouth were rows of teeth that were very small and could only be used to grab hold of prey as it swallowed it whole. In front of each dorsal fin was a stout spine, which some modern bottom-dwelling sharks like horn sharks and bullhead sharks also have. They might have used these spines for protection against larger predators. The shark's tail fin was unique in that the lower lobe was about the same size as the upper lobe, sometimes slightly bigger (in most sharks, the upper lobe is considerably longer than the lower). Unlike modern sharks, <i>Cladoselache</i> lacked the tooth-like scales, or denticles, covering its body. Outside of a few cusped scales in the areas around the eyes, and edges of the fins, <i>Cladoselache</i> was essentially "naked". The small brain and nasal cavies of this shark indicate that it didn't have a very strong sense of smell like most sharks, so it probably hunted by sight alone. Perhaps the biggest aspect that separates most sharks from <i>Cladoselache</i>  is that the male sharks lacked claspers, the pair of penis-like organs used to transfer sperm into the bodies of females during copulation. Since there's no hard evidence displaying how these sharks reproduced, the question how they did so remains unanswered.
