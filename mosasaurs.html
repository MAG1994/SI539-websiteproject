				Mosasaurs did not come into fruition until late in the Cretaceous period, but when they did, they flourished all throughout the oceans. No one knows the reason behind their sudden arrival, but many paleontologists believe the decline of other marine reptiles may have played a role. With the extinction of the ichthyosaurs near the start of the Cretaceous, and plesiosaurs facing competition from sharks and other fish, it was an ideal time for the mosasaurs to evolve. While it is still unclear about who the ancestors were for other marine reptiles, most paleontologists agree that mosasaurs evolved from small terrestrial lizards known as aigialosaurs that lived near the coastlines during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous. During the middle of the Cretaceous, the aigialosaurs ventured into the ocean and within the next few million years, had fully adapted to a life under the waves. Unlike most other marine reptiles, mosasaurs still maintained their, for lack of a better term, reptilian appearance, looking more like modern-day lizards and crocodilians, and had diamond-shaped scales similar to snakes. Many paleontologists credit the success of the mosasaurs to their large size. While most mosasaurs generally preferred living in coastal waters where food was plentiful, their immense bulk enabled them to safely navigate through the open ocean. A couple species have even been found to traverse through freshwater rivers, similarly to modern crocodiles.

				Much like plesiosaurs, mosasaurs were ambush predators, launching surprise on their prey and pursuing them for short distances. As the apex predators of the Cretaceous waters, mosasaurs would prey upon just about anything, ranging from fish and seabirds, to sharks and even smaller mosasaurs. To catch their prey, many mosasaurs had sharp teeth that were curved toward the back of their mouths to help guide prey down their throat. They also had teeth on their palates in order to keep prey from slipping away as they swallowed it. Other mosasaurs have rounded teeth designed to crush the shells of mollusks and sea urchins. The following are just a few examples of these apex predators.

				Growing to a length of over 14 meters, <i>Tylosaurus</i> was one of the largest mosasaur species. As the apex predator of the late Cretaceous, it would eat just about anything, even scavenging on the bodies of dinosaurs that had drowned and drifted out to sea. Although the <i>Tylosaurus</i> was long, its body was narrow, with a sloping skull and small flippers to reduce resistance, allowing these animals to reach high speeds. Some <i>Tylosaurus</i> skulls have been found with evidence of damage that is consistent with a massive impact, suggesting that <i>Tylosaurus</i> would ram into its prey to stun it, allowing for an easier kill. Some paleontologists also believe that <i>Tylosaurus</i> may have used its thick skull against others of its own kind when fighting over territory.

				One of the most prominent features that separates <i>Globidens</i> from other mosasaurs is its teeth. With a name meaning "globe teeth", these reptiles had round teeth that sat halfway into the jaws. These teeth worked similarly to a ballpein hammer, allowing the predator to crush the shells of mollusks and crustaceans. No one knows why <i>Globidens</i> chose to focus on shelled creatures but some paleontologists speculate that it may have resulted from a need to decrease the amount of competition between other mosasaurs for the same food sources. Others believe it was simply to fulfill an ecological niche to hunt for other prey.
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Platecarpus</i> was far from the largest mosasaur, but it is nevertheless one of the most important genera that we know about, as it has done the most to progress our knowledge of mosasaurs. It was the first mosasaur to reveal the presence of a bi-lobed fluked tail, and rock impressions have captured great detail of the animal's external features (scales included). They even managed to capture impressions of some of the internal organs, most notably the respiratory system. What is so significant about this discovery is that it showed that mosasaurs had two lungs, indicating that they were more closely related to monitor lizards than they are to snakes. Some <i>Platecarpus</i> fossils even have parts of the eyes preserved, which could allow paleontologists to learn about what the eyes looked like, as well as how they worked.

				<img src="images/Mosasaurus.jpg" height="240" alt="Mosasaurus">Like the name applies, <i>Mosasaurus</i> was the first genus of mosasaur to be discovered, and thus became the namesake of all others of its kind. With a length of more than fifteen meters, it was also the longest and most robust of the mosasaurs. Its size and heavy build indicates that that it almost certainly preyed upon other marine reptiles. Because <i>Mosasaurus</i>'s eyes were located on the sides of its head as opposed to the front, it lacked good binocular vision. The olfactory bulb was also poorly developed, so it did not have a good sense of smell, either. Because of these shortcomings, <i>Mosasaurus</i> probably hunted near the surface, waiting to ambush other marine reptiles that were surfacing for air. As a result, it probably had no need to dive any deeper than the maximum depth of where its prey inhabited.
