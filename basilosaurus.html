				If there's any prime example of a misnomer for a prehistoric animal, <i>Basilosaurus</i> would be it. While it did not officially get its name until the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the fossils of <i>Basilosaurus</i> were very commonplace in the American southeast, so much that they were actually used for furniture and interior decorating! When the fossils were first examined, they bore such a similarity to the ancient mosasaurs, that the animal was named <i>Basilosaurus</i>, Greek for "King Lizard". It wasn't until further analysis that people realized it was actually an ancient marine mammal; a primitive whale. Sir Richard Owen, best known for classifying the first dinosaurs, wanted to rename the animal <i>Zeuglodon</i>, meaning "yoke teeth", but taxonomic rules meant that the registered name was permanent.

The creature's skeleton suggests that the animal may have undulated its body like an eel, flapping its tail fluke up and down to propel itself forward. The powerful jaws held large teeth that were ideal for catching prey such as fish and even smaller whales. Compared to modern whales, <i>Basilosaurus</i> had a smaller brain cavity in its skull. Based on the fact that larger-brained cetaceans tend to be more social and swim together in pods, <i>Basilosaurus</i> probably hunted solo. <img src="C:/Users/Martin/Desktop/Prehistoric Marine Website/BasilosaurusSkull.jpg" height="240" alt="Basilosaurus Skull"> Its hollow spinal column, as well as its small lung size meant that the animal could not dive deep to pursue prey. The whale's front flippers still had elbow joints, suggesting that the whale had directly descended from terrestrial mammals. As whales evolved, this feature disappeared altogether. Only modern pinnipeds like seals and sea lions still have them. The small hind limbs of <i>Basilosaurus</i> might have been used to obtain a better grip during mating, but were mostly vestigial and would eventually disappear with evolution.
