				Of all the early marine crocodilians, <i>Metriorhynchus</i> is one of the best known for living a fully aquatic lifestyle vs. an amphibious lifestyle. Its limbs have evolved into flippers, and there's enough evidence to suggest that the tail has a fin on it. Many paleontologists believe that <i>Metriorhynchus</i> used its tail as the main source of propulsion, while it steered with its fins. Another key element in the animal's marine lifestyle is the presence of salt glands, which extracts excess salts from the blood so that they can be expelled from the body. This allowed the animal to drink seawater and consume other marine creatures that have higher levels of salt content than land animals.

				While <i>Metriorhynchus</i> spent most of its time beneath the waves, it mostly likely would have had to come on dry land in order to lay eggs. <i>Metriorhynchus</i> evolved from different lines than most other marine reptiles; since most of its ancestors were terrestrial, it most likely maintained a few similar traits.

				<i>Metriorhynchus</i> was certainly a predator, but there is also proof to suggest that <i>Metriorhynchus</i> may have been scavenger. It was also far from the top predator of the Jurassic seas, and may have been hunted by carnivores such as <i>Liopleurodon.</i>
